                            Rely on Uniforce for your front office medical receptionist staffing needs. A professionally trained medical receptionist welcomes patients with warmth and provides assistance with completion of necessary forms and documents, including required medical insurance information. In addition to informing patients about medical office policies and procedures, front office staff may be tasked with answering incoming calls, scheduling appointments, collecting co-pays and payments, as well as updating and maintaining medical records.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Other duties the medical receptionist may perform, depending on the size and structure of your medical front office, include obtaining external medical reports when requested by medical professionals, scheduling hospital admissions, tests, diagnostic imaging or other outside appointments for patients. HIPAA compliance is a must have qualification of any medical staff, including front office employees that Uniforce provides.

                            Depending on office structure, you may wish to reach out to Uniforce for a patient scheduler, a staff member who is supervised by licensed personnel and is responsible for scheduling medical services with local healthcare providers on behalf of the patients in need. Patient schedulers are typically a part of the medical front office team, with other shared responsibilities that may include clerical, receptionist and medical record maintenance.

                            Surgical schedulers take on responsibilities pertaining to the coordination of surgery. Additional interpersonal skills may be required, as a surgical scheduler will often meet with patients and their loved ones to communicate preoperative instructions and offer insights about logistics for the day of surgery, from directions to timing, to patient preparations. The surgical scheduler may also be tasked with following up on preoperative labs and test to ensure that they are completed prior to surgery. This staff member will likely be expected to field patient inquiries prior to surgery as well.
