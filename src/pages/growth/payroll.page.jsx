                            Any good carpenter will tell, “measure twice, cut once.” The same is true with taking on business growth strategies that are unproven. One of the best ways to reduce the risks associated with new initiatives is to put in place staffing budget controls. Intercom will provide a third party payroll solution that fits your budget, with no surprises.

                            Like beginning any new projects, adding a new employee, whether brought in as a temp or a direct hire, is an experiment in team chemistry. Even with diligent vetting, in certain situations, work performance can be extremely challenging to predict until an employee begins interacting with others and taking on tasks. For this reason, many Intercom clients embrace third party payroll solutions. 
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                            Our third party payroll solutions include great flexibility, allowing your company to try candidates in a variety of roles, including part-time and full-time staffing. Best of all, when you find a proven, indispensable team player, your company may extend an employment offer, to add the individual to your internal payroll, for a potential long-term position with company benefits at no conversion fee.

                        Evaluate new hires before you extend the full time staff offer. Let Intercom handle the W-2 Employer relationship as a temp-to-hire. You find the employee and Intercom puts them on our payroll. Recall experienced retirees. What do you do when an employee wants to retire, collect retirement funds, and return to work Part-Time? Employees cannot withdraw their Pension/401k retirement until they resign.

Why spend the time and money on boarding Summer Interns and Part-Time employees as in-house employees? Human Resources doesn’t need the headache of maintaining an employee census that has a seasonal workforce. Let Intercom handle the reporting and the W-2 Employer relationship for the Interns and Part-Timers. Your company handles the full time staff.

                        <h3>Medical record keeping is of paramount importance.</h3>
                        <p>
                            Coordinating with clinical staff, front office and billing professionals, medical record clerks are often at the hub of back office activity. Intercom offers medical record staffing solutions to ensure that patient information is handled with care for compliance, security and accuracy. Medical record clerks assign and record new records, verify existing record numbers, promptly deliver records when needed and maintain a systemized directory. A skilled medical record professional is responsible for maintaining a master index of all patients, establishing processes and procedures for record interaction and performs audits of record keeping compliance with medical industry best practices.
