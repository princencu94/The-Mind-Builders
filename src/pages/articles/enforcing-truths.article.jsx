                As humans, we have senses. We have memory. And we have a way of connecting every current experience to something from our past, to give context for how we should behave in the present situation.

            <p>
                And, in the world of interviewing in corporate America, as <strong>interviewers</strong>, we have preconceived notions about candidates that stem from experiences that have nothing to do with the candidate at hand. We all do.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So candidates, unbeknownst to them, think that they are being critiqued solely by <strong>their inner goodness, professional attire, and good words</strong>, yet a lot more is being considered than what is brought to the forefront in each conversation. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Before we go any further, let's take a small step back and consider another term for preconceived notion.<br/>

                It's a skewed thought, an inaccurate download of a present situation. <br/>

                I experienced X in the past, when I encountered Y detail about a person, so anytime I see this detail, it must be associated with that type of experience.

            </p>
            </Fade>
            <Fade>
            <p>
                Rather than listing all ways humans uses detail to associate a current experience as being good, bad, truthful, etc. I'm going to discuss <strong>how to enforce the truths you want interviewers to see about you.</strong> This can be applied to scenarios even outside of interviewing.
            </p>
            </Fade>
            <Fade>
            <h3>Encapsulate All Senses.</h3>
            <p>
                When interviewing, use all 5 senses to get your point across: sight, speech, touch, smell, and listening to iterate, reiterate, confirm, and enforce the perception you want an interviewer to have of you. And you need to <strong>do this throughout the interviewing experience.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                In the hiring space, we all want the same things in a Rockstar Candidate. I've coined it, The Great 8:
            </p>
            <ol role="list">
            <li>A professional</li>
            <li>Comes prepared</li>
            <li>Dedicated</li>
            <li>Intentional</li>
            <li>Knows what they're here to do</li>
            <li>Is eager to jump in and start contributing</li>
            <li>Someone open to learning and receiving feedback</li>
            <li>Someone who can get the job done</li>
           
            </ol>

            <p>
                So, how can candidates prove all of this in the first interview???? <br/>

                Trust me, if you're not checking off all of the boxes above, you leave a window open for rejection. <br/>

                So, to prove ourselves, we must satisfy as many senses of the interviewer as possible.  
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>For sight:</strong> we have a crystal clear, well written resume. Our LinkedIn profile picture is professional. Our LinkedIn page exists and looks decent. And upon seeing us for the first time, we are dressed professionally in a way that resembles the leadership team. This image/sight consistency covers rockstar qualities 1, 2, 4, and 8 listed above.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>For sound/hearing our voice:</strong> our story (the walk through our work history) has perfect transitions. Our words fit the context of the industry and role we are applying for. 
            </p>

            <p>
                A high-performer tip for engaging the senses of an interviewer is to use humor or topical commentary to reinforce your experience in the industry or understanding of how you can impact your job role to be the exact worker the company needs. This comes with time. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Here's an example of this: A B2B sales rep, during interviews, makes sure to mention cold-calling and how it's a necessary evil. Then they say, "gotta love it; that's where the long term growth is." Or, "can't let the well run dry". And in that humor, they are reinforcing their understanding of the role, their experience in the role, and that by acknowledging the toughest part of the job in a "been there, done that" attitude, they appear as though they know what they are here to do in this new sales role, are eager to jump in and start contributing, and can do the job. It could also indicate that they come prepared, and know what they are here to do...numbers 1, 2, 5, 6, and 8 of the Great 8.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>For touch:</strong> There are only one or two opportunities, usually - when a candidate shakes an interviewer's hand. Through a handshake, hiring managers can determine whether you're awkward or not, whether you are a professional and can show your eagerness to 'jump in and start contributing'. Through a handshake, we can also sense your ability to fit the team. A good handshake covers 1, 4, and potentially 6 and 8, of the Great 8.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>For Smell:</strong> Do NOT smell like anything if in person. Do not wear too much perfume. Don not smell musty or stinky. Your smell should not come to mind for anyone interviewing you. To not smell, you are approved for all 8 qualities of a great candidate. To smell - you have lost at least 6-7 items on the Great 8 candidate rockstar list above. Smelling is a no-no in the corporate space.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, the <strong>Voice of the interviewer! Our listening skills!</strong> Make sure in an interview that you let the interviewer talk about themselves and their team. People like to talk about themselves. Engage with their stories and get them talking even more! With this skill, you are sprinkling sauce on your professionalism by being someone who overall may "fit the team". When you engage with interviewers, interjecting at the right moments, it shows qualities 1, 5, 6, and 7 of the list above.
            </p>
            <p>
                A perfect blend of drawing in all 5 senses will ensure you get way more yeses than no's as you progress through interview stages. These Great 8 qualities are sought after by almost all hiring managers; so reminding interviewers of these qualities in you can result in positive outcomes in your interview journey.
